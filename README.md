# üå∏ BloomShort ‚Äì URL Shortener

Live Demo: <https://url-shortner-en2l.vercel.app/>

BloomShort is a modern, visually appealing URL shortener built with Next.js (App Router) and Supabase. It transforms long URLs into tiny, shareable ‚Äúblooms‚Äù with a smooth, playful frontend experience. Users can also add UTM parameters for marketing tracking, copy short URLs to clipboard, open them in a new tab, and generate QR codes for sharing.

## How it works

1. User enters a long URL and optional UTM parameters in the input form on the homepage.
2. The API (`/api/shorten`) generates a short random code and inserts it into Supabase.
3. The generated short URL is displayed:
   - Clicking it opens the original URL in a new browser tab.
   - Users can copy the URL to clipboard with a button.
   - A QR code for the URL is generated for easy scanning.
4. The `[code]` page fetches the original URL server-side using the Supabase service key and redirects the user.
