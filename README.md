# url-shortner
This is a project meant to collect all URL shortners available on the internet and create a single solution where people can just call one function and have a shortened URL from their favourite url shortner website.
I understand it might not be possible to use all the URL shortners since not all of them have an API. But I will try my best to include all possible websites.


## tinyurl
Currently the solution for tinyurl has been written. In order to use it, all you need to do is download this project, include it in your project path and then call:
`handleRequest(url, source)`
from the `index.js` file where:
* `url` is the url you want to shorten
* source should be `tinyurl`

###### Kindly do not forget to enter the Bitly API key in the Bitly.js file, else the solution will not work.
